# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Branching model

The promotion chain is strict and linear:

```
feature branch -> dev -> qa -> stage -> prod
```

- `dev` is the repository's default branch and the **only** branch feature work merges into.
  Feature branches are cut from `dev` and PR back into `dev`.
- `qa` receives promotions from `dev` only.
- `stage` receives promotions from `qa` only.
- `prod` receives promotions from `stage`, plus `hotfix/*` branches as the one sanctioned exception; it is what is live.
- `main` is kept as a **mirror of `prod`** (the conventional default name pointing at what is live).
  It is never a merge target for feature work; the only valid PR into `main` comes from `prod`.

Forward promotion moves **up** the chain and always requires the exact predecessor, so nothing is promoted into `prod` without passing through `qa` and `stage`.
The `hotfix/*` -> `prod` exception is the one way around that, and it is trusted **by branch name alone** — the check never verifies where a `hotfix/*` branch was cut from or what it contains, so any branch named `hotfix/anything` merges straight into `prod`.
That is the deliberate cost of having a fast path at all.
Merges **down** the chain are valid by design: `prod` -> `stage` and `stage` -> `qa` are back-merges, and the check accepts them alongside each base's forward source.

Hotfix path: cut `hotfix/*` from `prod`, PR it into `prod`, then PR `prod` -> `main` to re-establish the mirror, then back-merge `prod` down through `stage`, `qa`, and `dev`.
Skipping the back-merge means the next normal promotion silently reverts the fix; skipping the `main` sync leaves `main` no longer mirroring live code.
Each of those PRs is an accepted source, so the sanctioned procedure never requires merging past a failing check.

### What CI actually does, and what it cannot do

`.github/workflows/promotion-chain.yml` **flags** a pull request into `qa`, `stage`, `prod`, or `main` whose head branch is not a valid source: it surfaces the violation as a failed check on the PR.
Valid sources per base: `qa` <- `dev` or `stage`; `stage` <- `qa` or `prod`; `prod` <- `stage` or `hotfix/*`; `main` <- `prod`.
PRs into `dev` are deliberately unchecked because feature branch names are arbitrary.

The check is **advisory only — it cannot prevent anything.**
GitHub branch protection, rulesets, and required status checks all return `403 Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public` because the Trash-Talk-NYC org is on a free plan and this repo is private.
That single limitation has three consequences:

- A red promotion-chain run leaves the merge button fully enabled. Anyone with write access can merge an out-of-chain PR straight past the failing check.
- Nothing observes **direct pushes** to `qa`, `stage`, `prod`, or `main`. The workflow only runs on pull requests.
- For `pull_request` events the workflow definition is resolved from the PR merge ref, so a head branch that deletes or renames `.github/workflows/promotion-chain.yml` produces a PR with **no** promotion-chain check at all rather than a failing one — an absent check is not proof the chain was followed.

Leaving the chain advisory is a **deliberate accepted risk** taken by the captain (small team, nothing deployed yet), not an oversight.
If the repo ever goes public or the org upgrades to a paid plan, replace this check with real branch protection / rulesets and mark it a required status check.
