NFC-tagged tree bed network for Trash Talk NYC.

## Contributing

Branches follow a strict promotion chain:

```
feature branch -> dev -> qa -> stage -> prod
```

`dev` is the default branch and the only target for feature work; `main` mirrors `prod`.
A CI check (`.github/workflows/promotion-chain.yml`) flags pull requests into `qa`, `stage`, `prod`, or `main` that come from outside the chain, but it is advisory and cannot block a merge.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for where to branch from, how to promote, and the hotfix path.
